## Features

- Display the current message stored on the blockchain
- Update the message on the blockchain
- Attractive and modern UI design

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- Truffle (v5.x or later)
- Ganache (v6.x or later)
- MetaMask browser extension

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Priyanshrai//DApps_hello_world_smart_contract.git  
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Navigate to the `client` directory and install its dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Start Ganache:**
   ```bash
   ganache-cli
   ```

2. **Compile and deploy the smart contract:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate
   ```

3. **Configure MetaMask:**
   - Open MetaMask and create a new custom network.
   - Set the network name to "Ganache" (or any desired name).
   - Set the RPC URL to `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.
   - Set the Chain ID to `1337` (or the ID displayed in Ganache).
   - Import one of the Ganache accounts into MetaMask using its private key.

4. **Update the `HelloWorld.json` file in the `client/src/contracts` directory:**
   - Copy the contract ABI from the `build/contracts/HelloWorld.json` file.
   - Paste the ABI into the `client/src/contracts/HelloWorld.json` file.
   - Update the contract address in the `client/src/contracts/HelloWorld.json` file with the deployed contract address from Ganache.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the React development server:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the Hello Blockchain DApp.**

## Usage

- Connect MetaMask to the Ganache network.
- View the current message stored on the blockchain.
- Enter a new message in the input field and click "Update Message" to change the message stored on the blockchain.
- The message will be updated in real-time and displayed on the UI.

## Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains the Solidity smart contract.
- `migrations/`: Contains migration scripts for deploying the smart contract.
- `client/src/components/`: Contains the React components.
- `client/src/contracts/`: Contains the ABI and contract address for interacting with the smart contract.
- `client/src/HelloWorld.css`: Contains the CSS for styling the HelloWorld component.

## Smart Contract

The `HelloWorld.sol` smart contract is located in the `contracts` directory. It defines the following functions:

- `constructor(string memory initialMessage)`: Initializes the contract with a given message.
- `setMessage(string memory newMessage)`: Updates the message stored on the blockchain.
- `getMessage()`: Retrieves the current message stored on the blockchain.

The smart contract emits the following event:

- `MessageChanged(string newMessage)`: Emitted when the message is updated.
